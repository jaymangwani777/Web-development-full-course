console.log("hey this is tutorial 2 of javascript")

var a=5;
var b=6;
// var c=8;
// var d=23;
// var e=4;
var c="Jay"
// variable is basically a container which stores datatypes and value inside double coat is a string
// double coma means double coat and inside double coat value is a string 

console.log(a+b)

console.log(typeof a ,typeof b ,typeof c)
// this typeof code we write because we want to know datatype of value which is stored under a variable
// console.log(d+b)

// console.log(d+b+e)

// var _a="shubam";   
// that is correct

// var 55a="jay"
// that is incorrect 
// and why they are correct and incorrect just because it is a rule var cannot be begin with variables

// jay and Jay both are different variables because starting of names is differennt first one is starting with small letter and the second one is starting with a capital letter variables are case sensitive!
