// why we are using funcition?

// because we don't want to be repatative with our code!

// suppose we wrote 1000 lines of code and we have to change one or two things from those codes but apart from these one or two things the rest of code will be the same how we can do it ?

// the answer is we have to make a function after we made the function we can make changes in that function then the 1000 lines of code will change automatically!
